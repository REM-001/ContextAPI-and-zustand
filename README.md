# contextapi-and-zustand

This project provides a simple comparison of two popular state management solutions in React: Context API and Zustand.

**Context API** is a built-in React feature for sharing state across components without prop drilling.

**Zustand** is a small, fast, and scalable state management library with a simple and intuitive API.

This project demonstrates how to implement the same functionality using both approaches, allowing you to compare their syntax, usage, and performance considerations.
